## Users Plugin

This handles user registration, login/logout, activation etc. Each user has a `Profile` model which can be overridden in each site (by copying to the `plugins/models` directory) and extended with as many other attributes and associations as necessary for the site.

Explain different types of site - can users register and log in etc
